In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about bias, which refers to negative, unwanted consequences of ML applications, especially if the consequences disproportionately affect certain groups. [Get Started!](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/identifying-bias-in-ai/tutorial)

Now complete this exercise, you will [work directly with a model trained on real-world, biased data](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/15622654).
